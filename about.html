                <h2>My Academic Background</h2>
                <p>
                    My scholastic voyage began at Akonjo Primary School, where I persevered through scarce resources and formidable
                    challenges to secure 354 marks in KCPE. This milestone propelled me to St. Joseph‚Äôs School Rapogi, an institution
                    renowned for its rigorous standards. There, I navigated a demanding curriculum and high expectations with unwavering
                    focus and grit. Each hurdle only strengthened my resolve, forging a foundation of discipline and tenacity that continues
                    to drive my growth.
                    Through hard work and relentless dedication, I scored an impressive A- in KCSE, a result that opened doors for me to
                    pursue my passion in BSc. Information Technology at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). Every
                    challenge along the way has sharpened my resilience and deepened my commitment to excellence.

                <h2>My Turning Point</h2>
                <p>
                    After completing my KCSE exams, I received one of the greatest blessings of my life  a scholarship from Power Learn
                    Project (PLP). The joy and gratitude I felt in that moment are beyond words. It was more than just financial support; it
                    was a doorway to a future I had only dreamed of. This opportunity to study Software Engineering under the PLP program
                    became a defining moment  one that will shape my career, sharpen my skills, and empower me to build meaningful
                    solutions through technology. What once seemed like a distant dream is now a purpose I walk towards every single day.

                <h2>My Developing Background</h2>
                <p>
                    My journey into programming began in Form One, inspired by my brother who first introduced me to the world of code. I
                    took my first steps with Python, learning through online tutorials on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez">BroCode</a>. Initially, it felt overwhelming  the
                    concepts were unfamiliar, and I struggled to grasp even the basics.
                    
                    Balancing academic responsibilities with learning to code proved to be a significant challenge. There were moments of
                    frustration and doubt, but I remained determined. That persistence paid off. After successfully completing my KCSE exams
                    in Form Four, I finally had the time and mental clarity to focus fully on mastering programming.
                    
                    What once seemed incomprehensible has now become a passion I pursue with confidence and purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And now i'm a passionate developer with a strong interest in building user friendly and meaningful software.
                    My focus is on developing creative and impactful digital exeperiences using modern web technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy coding, solving problems, and learning new tools that empower me to grow as a developer.
                    This portfolio showcases some of my work, background, and interests. Enjoy the journey!
